# Spring into Data Science... with the Iris dataset!

This README.md file will serve as a roadmap to this repository. The repository is open and available to the public.

Directories and files to be aware of:

1. A notebooks/ directory that contains Jupyter notebooks: 
    - A notebook that explores predicting petal length with linear regression (predicting_petal_length.ipynb) 
    - A notebook exploring simple linear regression basics (simple_linear_regression_basics.ipynb)

2. A data/ directory containing one data file:
    - Due to GitHub upload restrictions, this is included as a .gitignore file. It is, in brief:   
      - IRIS.csv 
      - The data file described above can be found on Kaggle or from UCI's Machine Learning Laboratory (details on obtaining this data can be found in data/README.md).
    
Methodology: We create simple and multiple linear regression models with the Iris data. 

Result: The functionality is used in the following blogs on Medium:
  - Spring into Linear Regression (link [here](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/spring-into-linear-regression-17cf2c0813f8))
  - Spring into Linear Regression--Part 2 (link [here](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/spring-into-linear-regression-part-2-da51c22ceb02))
